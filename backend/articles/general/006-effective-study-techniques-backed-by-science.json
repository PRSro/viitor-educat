  "content": "# Effective Study Techniques Backed by Science\n\nNot all study methods are created equal. Here are techniques supported by cognitive science research:\n\n## Active Recall\nInstead of passively re-reading notes, test yourself. Flashcards, practice problems, and self-quizzing force your brain to retrieve information, strengthening neural pathways.\n\n## Spaced Repetition\nReview material at increasing intervals: 1 day → 3 days → 7 days → 14 days → 30 days. This combats the forgetting curve identified by Hermann Ebbinghaus.\n\n## Interleaving\nMix different topics or problem types during study sessions rather than blocking. This improves your ability to discriminate between concepts.\n\n## Elaborative Interrogation\nAsk \"why?\" and \"how?\" as you study. Connecting new material to existing knowledge creates stronger memory traces.\n\n## The Feynman Technique\n1. Choose a concept\n2. Explain it simply, as if teaching a child\n3. Identify gaps in your explanation\n4. Go back and fill those gaps\n\n## Resources\n- [The Learning Scientists](https://www.learningscientists.org/)\n- [Make It Stick (Book)](https://www.retrievalpractice.org/make-it-stick)\n- [Anki Spaced Repetition](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)",
