Examples: Linux, Firefox, Python, VS Code.\n\n## Why Contribute?\n- **Learn by doing**: Read real-world codebases and contribute fixes\n- **Build your portfolio**: Contributions are visible on GitHub\n- **Join a community**: Collaborate with developers worldwide\n- **Career advancement**: Many employers value open-source contributions\n\n## Getting Started\n1. **Find a project**: Look for \"good first issue\" labels on GitHub\n2. **Read the docs**: Every project has contribution guidelines\n3. **Start small**: Fix typos, improve documentation, then tackle bugs\n4. **Be respectful**: Follow codes of conduct and be patient\n\n## Key Platforms\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/)\n- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)\n- [First Contributions](https://firstcontributions.github.io/)\n- [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/)\n\n## Open Source in Education\nProjects like OpenStax, Khan Academy, and MIT OCW demonstrate how open principles can democratize education globally.\n\n## Resources\n- [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/)\n- [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)\n- [The Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/)",
